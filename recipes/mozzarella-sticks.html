    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until
      golden and crispy on the outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside.
      They're so good and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in a
      marinara sauce!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and
        garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch
        together in a third bowl. Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a
        large, heavy saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg
        mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread
        crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack.
        Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks
        into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from
        heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella
        sticks.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
